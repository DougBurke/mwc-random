Efficient, general purpose pseudo-random number generation
----------------------------------------------------------

This package provides the System.Random.MWC module, a Haskell library
for generating high-quality pseudo-random numbers in a space- and
time-efficient way.


Performance
-----------

This library has been carefully optimised for high performance.  To
obtain the best runtime efficiency, it is imperative to compile
libraries and applications that use this library using a high level of
optimisation.

Suggested GHC options:

  -O -fvia-C -funbox-strict-fields

To illustrate, here are the times (in seconds) to generate and sum 250
million random Word32 values, on a laptop with a 2.4GHz Core2 Duo
P8600 processor, running Fedora 11 and GHC 6.10.3:

  no flags   200+
  -O           1.249
  -O -fvia-C   0.991

As the numbers above suggest, compiling without optimisation will
yield unacceptable performance.
